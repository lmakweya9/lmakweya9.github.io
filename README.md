# Lesego Makweya | Software Engineer Portfolio

## 🚀 Overview
A high-performance, responsive portfolio showcasing professional software engineering projects, with a focus on scalable architecture, secure backend systems, and AI implementation. This site serves as a technical deep-dive into my work with **Python (FastAPI), React, and Machine Learning**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture
This portfolio is built as a static site but serves as a gateway to several full-stack applications.

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Modern Flex/Grid), JavaScript (ES6+).
* **Design:** Dual-theme system (Dark/Light mode) with a "Mobile-First" approach.
* **Infrastructure:** * **GitHub Pages:** Portfolio hosting.
    * **Vercel:** Frontend hosting for React applications.
    * **Render:** Backend hosting for FastAPI/PostgreSQL services.
* **Contact System:** Integrated with **Formspree.io** for serverless lead capture.

## 🌟 Key Features
* **Interactive Case Studies:** Individual project pages detailing the "Technical Challenge" and "Achievements" for each build.
* **Secure Project Integrations:** Showcasing live implementations of **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** and **Bcrypt** encryption.
* **AI/ML Focus:** Dedicated sections for NLP (FairCV-Match) and data-driven logic.
* **Performance Optimized:** Minified assets and semantic HTML for high SEO rankings and accessibility.

## 📂 Project Showcase

### 1. Freelance Management Dashboard
* **Stack:** React, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, JWT.
* **Key Feature:** A secure financial hub for freelancers to track real-time revenue and manage clients via a stateless authentication system.

### 2. FairCV-Match (NLP Tool)
